# 🎯 REVISED Pricing Strategy - NO UNLIMITED + Per-Seat + Per-Location

**Date**: October 2025
**Status**: NEW pricing model - Eliminates unlimited risk
**Goal**: Predictable costs + Revenue expansion via seats & locations

---

## 🚨 WHY WE CHANGED (From "Unlimited" Model)

### Problems with "Unlimited":
1. **Unpredictable Costs**: Customer using 1,000+ AI minutes = we lose money
2. **No Revenue Expansion**: Once they're on Pro, revenue is flat
3. **No Enterprise Differentiation**: Enterprise was just "more locations"
4. **Leaving Money on Table**: Multi-user teams get unlimited access for $197

### New Model Advantages:
1. **Predictable Costs**: Everything is capped - we know max cost per customer
2. **Revenue Expansion**: Seats + locations = growing MRR from existing customers
3. **Clear Enterprise Value**: Exclusive features (custom AI, white-label, API)
4. **Fair Pricing**: More users/locations = more value = more revenue

## ✅ What This Solves

### 1. **Eliminates Unlimited Risk**
- ❌ Old: Customer uses 1,000 AI minutes = we lose money
- ✅ New: Capped at 500 (Pro) or 2,000 (Enterprise) = predictable costs

### 2. **Revenue Expansion**
- ❌ Old: Pro customer pays $197 forever
- ✅ New: Pro customer grows team → adds seats → $247, $297, $422+

### 3. **Enterprise Differentiation**
- ❌ Old: Enterprise = just more locations
- ✅ New: Enterprise = Custom AI + White-label + API + Multi-location analytics

### 4. **Fair Pricing**
- ❌ Old: 1 user or 10 users = same price
- ✅ New: 10 users = more value = more revenue ($25/seat)

### 5. **Predictable Unit Economics**
- ❌ Old: Can't predict costs
- ✅ New: Know max cost per tier, can model profitability
