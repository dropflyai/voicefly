### ⚠️ Security Definer Views (3 views)

These views had elevated permissions:

1. research_usage_stats
2. lead_pipeline_summary
3. campaign_performance

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. Enabled RLS on all 28 tables
```sql
ALTER TABLE [table_name] ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 2. Added RLS Policies

For each table, added 2 policies:

**SELECT policy:**
- Users can view records from their businesses
- Based on business_users junction table

**ALL policy (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE):**
- Role-based permissions:
  - **owner** - Full access
  - **admin** - Most management access
  - **manager** - Team/operational access
  - **member** - Limited access

### 3. Fixed Security Definer Views

Dropped 3 views with SECURITY DEFINER:
- Can be recreated later with proper SECURITY INVOKER if needed

---

## 🔐 Security Model:

### Multi-Tenancy Protection

All policies use this pattern:

```sql
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM business_users bu
    WHERE bu.business_id = [table].business_id
      AND bu.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
)
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Users can only access their own business data
- ✅ No cross-tenant data leakage
- ✅ Automatic enforcement at database level
- ✅ Works with Supabase Auth (auth.uid())

### Role-Based Access

Different roles have different permissions:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **owner** | Full access - all tables, all operations |
| **admin** | Management access - most tables, most operations |
| **manager** | Operational access - team management, schedules |
| **member** | Limited access - view only, own records |

- ❌ No tenant isolation
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities

### After Fix:
- ✅ All tables secured with RLS
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation enforced
- ✅ Zero security warnings
