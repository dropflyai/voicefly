## üö® Risk Analysis

### Biggest Cost Risk: AI Call Minutes

**Professional tier is "unlimited" AI minutes:**
- Average user: 250 minutes/month = $25 cost
- Heavy user: 1,000 minutes/month = $100 cost
- Extreme user: 2,000 minutes/month = $200 cost

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Monitor usage patterns
2. Implement "fair use" policy after 1,000 min/month
3. Outliers (>1,000 min) = <5% of users
4. Even at 1,000 min ($100 cost), we still profit $97/month

**Break-even point**: 1,970 minutes/month ($197 cost = $197 revenue)
- Extremely unlikely - would be 65 calls/day
