## 🚀 Launch Readiness Assessment

### Can Launch NOW? ✅ YES

**Minimum Viable Product**:
- ✅ Website loads and looks professional
- ✅ Signup/login functional
- ✅ Dashboard working
- ✅ Core features exist (appointments, customers, marketing)
- ✅ API integrations in place (Vapi, Supabase)
- ✅ No critical runtime errors

### Launch Strategy: **Hybrid Model**

**What works TODAY**:
1. ✅ Manual onboarding for enterprise customers
2. ✅ Self-serve signup for SaaS tier
3. ✅ Current pricing ($147/$397/$997) is functional
4. ✅ Voice AI system can be configured manually
5. ✅ Dashboard provides full business management

**What needs manual workaround**:
1. ⚠️ Auto dealer customer → Configure manually, invoice separately
2. ⚠️ Custom websites → Hire freelancer or build manually
3. ⚠️ SEO services → Use external agency or DIY
4. ⚠️ Module marketplace → Not available, sell as single packages
5. ⚠️ Industry snapshots → Configure manually per customer
