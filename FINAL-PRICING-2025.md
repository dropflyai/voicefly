## 🎯 Strategic Location Pricing (The Secret Sauce)

### Why Location Pricing Matters:

**Professional Locations: $100/mo** (EXPENSIVE)
- 2 locations: $394 + $100 = $494/mo
- 3 locations: $394 + $200 = $594/mo
- 4 locations: $394 + $300 = **$694/mo** (getting expensive!)

**Enterprise Locations: $50/mo** (CHEAP - Volume discount)
- 6 locations: $994 + $50 = $1,044/mo
- 8 locations: $994 + $150 = $1,144/mo
- 10 locations: $994 + $250 = **$1,244/mo** (better value!)

### The Math:

**Pro with 3 locations**: $594/mo
**Enterprise with 5 locations**: $994/mo (includes everything + exclusive features)

**Value proposition**: For just $400 more, you get:
- 2 more locations included
- Custom AI personality
- White-label branding
- API access
- Multi-location analytics
- Dedicated support
- Cheaper location add-ons ($50 vs $100)
