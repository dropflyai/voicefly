## 💡 How It Works

### The Magic: Context Detection

The system automatically knows:
- **What page you're on** (leads, marketing, appointments, etc.)
- **What you're looking at** (specific lead, customer, competitor)
- **What you might need** (prospect research, talking points, market data)

**Example 1: On a Lead Page**
```
You visit: /dashboard/leads/123
System detects: Lead #123 "Dr. Smith Dental"
Cmd+K suggests:
  → "Research Dr. Smith Dental pain points"
  → "What competitors does Dr. Smith use?"
  → "Get demo talking points for Dr. Smith"
```

**Example 2: On Marketing Page**
```
You visit: /dashboard/marketing/campaigns
System detects: Marketing context
Cmd+K suggests:
  → "Research dental practice pain points"
  → "Top objections from medical practices"
  → "Market trends in healthcare AI"
```
