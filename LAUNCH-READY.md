## üö® Common Questions

### Q: Should I deploy production before getting customers?
**A**: No! Start with local dev environment (Path B) and get your first 2-3 customers. This validates demand before infrastructure investment. Deploy to production once you have paying customers.

### Q: What if I don't get responses on LinkedIn?
**A**: Keep sending! 10-15% response rate means 85-90% don't respond. Send 50/day and you'll get 5-7 responses. Also test different message templates.

### Q: How long should demos be?
**A**: 15 minutes max. Any longer and you lose them. Show value fast.

### Q: What if someone asks for a feature we don't have?
**A**: Say "Great idea! We can add that. What we have today handles 95% of your needs. Want to start with that and we'll add [feature] within 30 days?"

### Q: Should I offer discounts?
**A**: You already have a launch special ($297/mo instead of $497/mo). Don't discount further. Adds value and urgency.

### Q: What if I can't close 10 customers in Week 1?
**A**: That's okay! Even 5 customers = $1,485 MRR = $17,820 ARR. Just keep going. The process compounds.
