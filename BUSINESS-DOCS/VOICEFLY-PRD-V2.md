### C. Pricing Philosophy

VoiceFly's pricing is designed around three principles:

**1. Value-Based, Not Cost-Based**
- Price based on customer value, not our costs
- Example: AI Phone Agent costs us $0.08/minute but we charge $0.16/minute because it saves customer $50/hour in receptionist costs

**2. Transparent & Predictable**
- No hidden fees or surprise charges
- Clear pricing tiers
- Usage limits clearly stated
- Overage pricing disclosed upfront

**3. Flexible Entry, High Expansion**
- Low barrier to entry ($49/month Starter)
- Easy to add tools as needed
- Natural upgrade path (Starter ‚Üí Pro ‚Üí Enterprise)
- Expansion revenue = 30% of total revenue (target)

**Pricing Rationale by Tier:**

**Starter ($49/month):**
- Competes with Calendly ($16) + M1 ($30) = $46
- Slightly higher but includes CRM + more features
- Target: Solo entrepreneurs, testers

**Professional ($99/month):**
- Competes with Podium ($289) at 1/3 the price
- Value: Full platform vs single-feature tools
- Target: Growing businesses, small teams

**Enterprise ($299/month):**
- Competes with HubSpot ($800+) at 1/4 the price
- Plus white-label option (GoHighLevel charges $497 just for white-label)
- Target: Multi-location, agencies, white-label

**Service Modules ($19-499/month):**
- Priced at 50-70% of standalone competitor tools
- Example: Our Email Marketing ($29-99) vs Mailchimp ($50-300)
- Example: Our SMS ($19-79) vs Podium ($289 for limited SMS)

**Industry Snapshots ($149-497/month):**
- Bundled pricing = 50% discount vs buying separately
- Auto Dealer Snapshot ($349) saves $348/month
- Makes value obvious, encourages adoption

**Enterprise Services (Custom):**
- Market-rate pricing (competitive with agencies)
- SEO: $1,500-5,000/month (vs typical $2,000-8,000)
- Websites: $2,000-20,000 (vs typical $5,000-50,000)
- Lead Gen: $2,000-5,000/month (vs typical $3,000-10,000)
