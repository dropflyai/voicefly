## 🎯 Closing Tips

### Handle Objections:

**"It's too expensive"**
→ "Compare to hiring a receptionist at $35K/year. VoiceFly is $3,564/year. You save $31,000."

**"We need to think about it"**
→ "I understand. What specific concerns do you have? Let me address those now."

**"Can we start smaller?"**
→ "Absolutely. We can start with Starter plan at $297/month. No contract, cancel anytime."

**"We already have a system"**
→ "Great! VoiceFly integrates with existing systems. Plus, you get the AI Research Hub which your current system definitely doesn't have."

### Ask for the Sale:

"Based on what I've shown you - the AI voice assistant, the research hub, the payment processing - which plan makes the most sense for your business?"

(Pause. Let them answer.)

"Excellent. I can have you up and running by end of day. Let's get your account set up."
