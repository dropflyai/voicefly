  console.log('Booking status:', data.booking_successful)
})
```

---

### Industry Benchmark Reporting

**Benchmark Data Collection:**
```sql
-- Example queries for benchmarks
SELECT
  industry,
  AVG(booking_rate) as avg_booking_rate,
  AVG(call_duration) as avg_duration,
  AVG(customer_satisfaction) as avg_satisfaction,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY booking_rate) as top_10_percent
FROM conversation_analytics
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY industry
```

**Monthly Reports (Automated):**
- Email to all customers: "Your Industry Benchmark Report"
- Comparisons: Your business vs industry average vs top 10%
- Recommendations based on gaps
- Trend analysis (month-over-month)

**Example Report:**
```
Beauty & Wellness Industry Benchmarks - October 2025

Your Salon:
├── Booking Rate: 38% (↑ +5% from last month)
├── Avg Call Duration: 3.2 minutes
├── Customer Satisfaction: 4.7/5
└── ROI: 24.3x

Industry Averages:
├── Booking Rate: 28% [You're 36% better]
├── Avg Call Duration: 4.1 minutes [You're 22% faster]
├── Customer Satisfaction: 4.2/5 [You're 12% higher]
└── ROI: 18.1x

Top 10% of Salons:
├── Booking Rate: 45% [You're 84% of top performers]

## Phase 3: Category Leadership & Scale (Q3-Q4 2026)

### Objective: Establish category leadership and prepare for Series A

### Predictive Analytics Engine

**ML Models for Business Intelligence:**

1. **Lead Scoring Model**
```python
# Predict likelihood of booking
features = [
    'lead_source',
    'time_of_day',
    'previous_interactions',
    'customer_ltv_estimate',
    'industry_segment'
]

booking_probability = predict_booking(features)
# Route high-probability leads to best agents
# Prioritize follow-up for warm leads
```

2. **Churn Prediction**
```python
# Predict customer churn risk
risk_factors = [
    'usage_frequency',
    'support_tickets',
    'payment_failures',
    'feature_adoption_rate'
]

churn_risk = predict_churn(risk_factors)
# Proactive outreach for at-risk customers
```

3. **Revenue Forecasting**
```python
# Predict next 90 days revenue
forecast = predict_revenue(
    historical_bookings,
    seasonality_patterns,
    marketing_spend,
    industry_trends
)
# Show customers: "Projected revenue next quarter: $45K"
```

**AI Recommendations Engine:**
```
Proactive Suggestions:
├── "Your no-show rate is 18%. Add SMS reminders to reduce to 8%"
├── "Customers who use feature X have 25% higher booking rates"
├── "Your busiest hour is 2pm. Add a second phone line?"
└── "Top salons in your area average $52K/month. You're at $38K. Here's how to close the gap..."
```
