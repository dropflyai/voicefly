Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Practice Name] focuses on exceptional patient care. Quick question:

How much time does your front desk spend on appointment scheduling vs actual patient interaction?

I've built an AI receptionist that handles 24/7 appointment booking, insurance verification, and patient inquiries - freeing your staff to focus on what matters.

Worth a 5-minute demo? It typically saves practices $30K/year in reception costs.

Best,
Rio
```

#### **Template 2: Medical Practices**
```
Hi [First Name],

Saw that [Practice Name] serves the [Location] community. Quick question:

How many potential patients call after hours and get voicemail instead of booking?

I've built Maya - an AI medical scheduler that books appointments 24/7, verifies insurance, and handles routine inquiries. Never miss another patient again.

Interested in a quick demo? Most practices see 30% more bookings.

Best,
Rio
```

#### **Template 3: Beauty/Spa**
```
Hi [First Name],

[Business Name] looks amazing! Quick question:

How many clients call to book when you're busy with other clients?

I've built an AI receptionist that books appointments 24/7, sends confirmations, and handles rescheduling - so you never miss revenue.

Worth a 5-minute demo? It's like having a $35K/year receptionist for $297/month.

Best,
Rio
```

## **ðŸ“ž OBJECTION HANDLING**

### **"We already have a receptionist"**
"That's great! Maya works alongside your team. She handles overflow calls, after-hours bookings, and routine scheduling so your receptionist can focus on in-person patients and complex issues. Most practices find their staff becomes more efficient, not redundant."

### **"What if the AI makes mistakes?"**
"Maya is trained specifically for [your industry] and has built-in safeguards. She confirms all appointment details, sends automatic confirmations, and escalates complex issues to your staff. Plus, you can see every interaction in real-time and make adjustments."

### **"How do patients feel about AI?"**
"Patients love it! They get immediate responses 24/7 instead of voicemail. Maya is incredibly natural - most people don't realize it's AI. We've found 85% patient satisfaction rates, often higher than traditional reception."

### **"What about technical issues?"**
"VoiceFly runs on enterprise-grade infrastructure with 99.9% uptime. If there are ever issues, calls automatically route to your existing system. Plus, I personally handle all technical support for the first 50 customers."

### **"It's too expensive"**
"I understand cost is important. Let's look at the math: your current reception costs are likely $35,000/year plus benefits. VoiceFly is $3,564/year - that's $31,000+ in annual savings. It pays for itself in the first month."
