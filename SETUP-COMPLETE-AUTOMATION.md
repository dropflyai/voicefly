# Complete Automation Setup Guide
## VoiceFly AI Research & Marketing System

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Database Migration & API Keys

---

## üéØ What We Built

You now have a **fully autonomous AI research and marketing automation system** that works WITHOUT n8n. Everything runs directly in Next.js with Supabase.

### Core Features Implemented:

1. **Omnipresent AI Research** (Cmd+K from anywhere)
   - Deep research mode (2-4 min comprehensive analysis)
   - Quick answers (30 sec)
   - Prospect intelligence (pain points, buying signals)
   - Competitor analysis (feature comparison, win strategies)
   - Market research (TAM/SAM, trends)

2. **Smart Actions** (Context-aware workflow integration)
   - Add to Lead Notes (save research to CRM)
   - Create Email Campaigns (extract insights ‚Üí pre-filled campaign)
   - Generate Voice Scripts (VAPI-ready call scripts)
   - Save Templates (reusable queries)
   - Copy to Clipboard

3. **Database Schema** (Complete multi-tenant structure)
   - Leads & prospects tracking
   - Research history with full logging
   - Marketing campaigns (email/SMS/voice)
   - Voice campaigns with VAPI integration
   - Campaign recipients & performance tracking

4. **API Integrations** (Production-ready)
   - Claude AI for real research (with template fallback)
   - Supabase for all data persistence
   - Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenancy
   - Streaming responses for real-time UX

## üìã Setup Checklist

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations

**You MUST run this migration before the system will work.**

```bash
# Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/sql/new
2. Copy all contents from: migrations/add-research-and-campaigns-tables.sql
3. Paste and click "Run"
```

**OR**

```bash
# Method 2: Using psql
psql "postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres" \
  -f migrations/add-research-and-campaigns-tables.sql
```

**Verify Migration:**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL editor:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN (
  'leads', 'lead_notes', 'research_history', 'research_templates',
  'marketing_campaigns', 'campaign_recipients',
  'voice_campaigns', 'voice_campaign_calls'
);
-- Should return 8 rows
```

---

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Existing Supabase vars (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key

# NEW: Claude AI API Key (REQUIRED for real research)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... # Get from https://console.anthropic.com

# Optional: Email sending (for marketing campaigns)
# NOTE: Email sending is marked as "Coming Soon" - no rush to set this up
RESEND_API_KEY=re_... # Get from https://resend.com (when ready)
```

**Getting Claude API Key:**
1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com
2. Sign up / Log in
3. Go to "API Keys"
4. Create new key
5. Copy and paste into `.env.local`

**Cost Estimate:** ~$0.002 per research query (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

---

### Step 3: Test the System

#### 1. Start Dev Server
```bash
PORT=3021 npm run dev
```

#### 2. Open Dashboard
```
http://localhost:3021/dashboard
```

#### 3. Test Research
1. Press `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K` on Windows)
2. Type: "Research medical practice pain points"
3. Select "Market Research" mode
4. Watch results stream in
5. Click "Copy to Clipboard" (should work)

#### 4. Verify Database Saves
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL editor:
SELECT * FROM research_history ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
-- Should show your test query
```

| Feature | Why Not Implemented | How to Add (Future) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Email Sending | Requires Resend/Sendgrid integration | Add Resend API, create `/api/campaigns/send` route |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Research shows templates, not real AI

**Fix:** Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env.local`

```bash
# .env.local
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

Restart dev server after adding.

---

### Issue: "Add to Notes" says "Coming Soon"

**Reason:** No leads in database yet.

**Fix:** Create a test lead:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL editor:
INSERT INTO leads (business_id, first_name, last_name, email, company_name, lead_status)
VALUES (
  'YOUR_BUSINESS_ID',  -- Replace with your business ID
  'John',
  'Doe',
  'john@example.com',
  'Test Company',
  'new'
)
RETURNING *;
```

Then try "Add to Notes" with the returned lead ID.

---

### Issue: Database errors when running queries

**Fix:** Make sure you ran the migration:

```bash
# Check if tables exist:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name LIKE '%research%';

# Should return: research_history, research_templates
```

If not found, run `migrations/add-research-and-campaigns-tables.sql`

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Use Context Suggestions
Don't type manually - click the smart suggestions:
- On lead pages: "Research this prospect"
- On marketing pages: "Research audience pain points"
- Anywhere: Recent searches

### 2. Save Templates
Common queries ‚Üí Save as template ‚Üí Reuse with variables:
```
Template: "Research {company_name} {industry} pain points"
```

### 3. Chain Research Modes
```
1. Market Research: "Dental practice market"
2. Competitor Analysis: "Top solutions in dental"
3. Prospect Intel: "Specific dental practice"
Result: Complete picture in 10 minutes
```
