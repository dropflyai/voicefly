## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Payment processing bugs** → Test extensively before launch
2. **AI phone agent quality** → Use Vapi's enterprise tier, implement fallbacks
3. **Enterprise deal delays** → Start outreach NOW, don't wait for Nov 1
4. **Missing features** → Focus on core value, defer nice-to-haves

### Contingency Plans
- If payment processing not ready → Manual invoicing for first month
- If auto dealer snapshot delayed → Use beauty snapshot to prove model
- If no enterprise deals → Focus on SaaS customer acquisition
