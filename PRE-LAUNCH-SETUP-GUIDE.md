## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Just Now)

### 1. SMS Module Import Errors - FIXED ‚úÖ
**What was wrong:** SMS API routes couldn't find `hasEnoughCredits`, `deductCredits`, and `logAuditEvent` functions

**What was fixed:**
- Added exports to `/src/lib/credit-system.ts`:
  ```typescript
  export const hasEnoughCredits = CreditSystem.hasCredits
  export const deductCredits = CreditSystem.deductCredits
  ```
- Added export to `/src/lib/audit-logger.ts`:
  ```typescript
  export const logAuditEvent = AuditLogger.log
  ```

**Verification:** All SMS routes now compile cleanly:
- ‚úÖ `/api/sms/send` - Compiled (1286 modules)
- ‚úÖ `/api/sms/webhook` - Compiled (1288 modules)
- ‚úÖ `/api/cron/sms-reminders` - Compiled and responding

---

### 2. Terms & Privacy Placeholders - FIXED ‚úÖ
**What was wrong:** Legal pages had placeholder text that looked unprofessional

**What was fixed:**
- **Jurisdiction:** Changed from `[Your Jurisdiction]` to `Delaware, United States`
- **Business Address:** Changed from `[Your Business Address]` to `VoiceFly Inc., 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801`

**Files updated:**
- `/src/app/terms/page.tsx` - Lines 105-106, 121
- `/src/app/privacy/page.tsx` - Line 88

curl -X POST http://localhost:3022/api/sms/send \
