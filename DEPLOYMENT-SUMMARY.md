## 🔧 Next Steps (Domain Setup)

### 1. Configure voiceflyai.com in Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dropflyai/voicefly-app)
2. Click **"Domains"** tab
3. Click **"Add Domain"**
4. Enter: `voiceflyai.com`
5. Click **"Add"**

### 2. Update DNS Records (at your domain registrar)

Add these DNS records for voiceflyai.com:

```dns
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21
TTL: 3600

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 3600
```

### 3. Add Subdomain (Optional)

If you want `www.voiceflyai.com`:
1. In Vercel, add `www.voiceflyai.com` as a domain
2. Set it to redirect to `voiceflyai.com`

### 4. Wait for SSL Certificate

- Vercel auto-provisions SSL (Let's Encrypt)
- Usually takes 5-10 minutes after DNS propagates
- DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours

### 5. Verify Deployment

Once DNS is set up:
1. Visit https://voiceflyai.com
2. Check SSL certificate is valid
3. Test all dashboard pages:
   - https://voiceflyai.com/dashboard/leads
   - https://voiceflyai.com/dashboard/leads/request
   - https://voiceflyai.com/dashboard/campaigns
