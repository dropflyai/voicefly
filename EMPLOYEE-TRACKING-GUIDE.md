## 📊 What Gets Tracked

### **Automatic Tracking (No Code Needed)**
The system **automatically logs** every action:

#### **1. User Actions**
- ✅ **Login** - Timestamp, IP address, device
- ✅ **Logout** - When they sign out
- ✅ **Session duration** - How long they were active

#### **2. Data Changes**
- ✅ **Services** - Created, updated, deleted
- ✅ **Customers** - Added, modified, removed
- ✅ **Appointments** - Scheduled, rescheduled, cancelled
- ✅ **Staff** - Team member changes

#### **3. What's Recorded**
```javascript
{
  who: "John Smith (john@acme.com)",
  what: "updated",
  entity: "customer",
  name: "Sarah Parker",
  when: "2 hours ago",
  changes: {
    old: { phone: "555-1234" },
    new: { phone: "555-5678" }
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Viewing Activity Logs

### **Option 1: Activity Log Component**
Add to any page:
```tsx
import ActivityLog from '@/components/ActivityLog'

// Show last 20 activities
<ActivityLog limit={20} />
```

### **Option 2: Database Query**
```sql
-- Get recent activity for your business
SELECT * FROM get_recent_activity('business-id-here', 50);

-- Get specific user's activity
SELECT * FROM get_user_activity('user-id', 'business-id', 100);

-- Get all audit logs
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE business_id = 'your-business-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Option 3: Via Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to Supabase → SQL Editor
2. Run: `SELECT * FROM audit_logs_readable LIMIT 100;`
3. See formatted activity log
