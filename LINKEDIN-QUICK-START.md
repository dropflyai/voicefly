## ⚡ 15-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Optimize Your LinkedIn Profile (5 min)

#### Update Headline:
```
Founder @ VoiceFly | AI Phone Agent for Medical/Dental Practices |
We answer your calls 24/7 so you never miss a patient
```

#### Update About Section:
```
I built VoiceFly to solve a problem every practice faces: missing
calls = missing revenue.

Our AI receptionist Maya:
✅ Answers calls 24/7 (even at 2 AM)
✅ Books appointments automatically
✅ Verifies insurance information
✅ Reduces no-shows by 60%
✅ Costs $297/month (vs $35K/year for staff)

Helping 100+ practices capture more patients and free up staff time.

```

### Step 2: Copy These 3 Message Templates (5 min)

#### Template A: Dental Practices
```
Hi [Name], noticed [Practice Name] focuses on exceptional care. Quick question:

How much time does your front desk spend on appointment scheduling vs patient interaction?

I've built an AI that handles 24/7 booking + insurance verification, saving practices $30K/year. Worth a 5-min demo?

Best, Rio
```

#### Template B: Medical Practices
```
Hi [Name], saw [Practice Name] serves the [City] community.

How many potential patients call after-hours and hit voicemail?

Maya (our AI scheduler) books appointments 24/7 and verifies insurance. Never miss another patient. Most practices see 30% more bookings.

Interested in a quick demo?

Best, Rio
```

#### Template C: Beauty Salons
```
Hi [Name], [Salon Name] looks amazing!

How many clients call to book while you're busy with other clients?

My AI books appointments 24/7, sends confirmations, handles rescheduling. Like a $35K/year receptionist for $297/month.

Worth a 5-min demo?

Best, Rio
```

### Step 3: Find Your First 20 Prospects (5 min)

**LinkedIn Search Strings**:

1. **Dental Practice Owners**:
```

## 🎪 Objection Handling

### "How is this different from [Competitor]?"
**Answer**:
"Great question. Most solutions are just scheduling software.
Maya actually ANSWERS your calls like a human receptionist,
books appointments, AND manages your calendar. Plus we're
50-70% cheaper and you're live in 10 minutes vs weeks."

### "We already have a receptionist"
**Answer**:
"Perfect! Maya works 24/7, so she handles:
- After-hours calls (30% of bookings)
- When your receptionist is on lunch/break
- Overflow when multiple calls come in
- Sick days and vacations

Most practices keep their receptionist for check-ins and
complex issues, while Maya handles routine bookings."

### "I need to talk to my partner/team"
**Answer**:
"Totally understand. What questions do they have?
Want me to do a quick 5-minute demo for the whole
team tomorrow? I can show them exactly how it works."

### "This is too expensive"
**Answer**:
"I get it. Let's do the math:
- Receptionist: $35K/year + benefits + sick days
- VoiceFly: $3,564/year (12 months)
- Savings: $31,436/year

Plus, if Maya books just 1 extra patient per day at
$200/visit, that's $73K/year in new revenue.

Try it free for 7 days - see the ROI yourself."

### "I need to think about it"
**Answer**:
"Absolutely. What's your main concern - price,
implementation, or just need time to process?

Here's what I'll do: I'll send you access to a 7-day
free trial. No credit card needed. You can test it
risk-free and decide. Sound fair?"

## 🎯 Pro Tips for Success

### 1. **Send Early Morning** (7-9 AM)
People check LinkedIn before work. Higher open rates.

### 2. **Personalize First Line**
Reference something specific about their practice.

### 3. **Keep It Short**
4-5 lines max. People are busy.

### 4. **Lead with Pain Point**
"How many calls do you miss?" hits harder than features.

### 5. **Make CTA Easy**
"Worth a 5-min demo?" is easier to say yes to than
"Let me know if you're interested."

### 6. **Follow Up Quickly**
Respond within 5 minutes when someone shows interest.

### 7. **Book Demos Fast**
Same-day or next-day slots convert better.

### 8. **Do Demos Live**
Seeing Maya answer a call in real-time > screenshots.

### 9. **Close on the Demo Call**
Don't leave without asking for the sale.

### 10. **Start Trial Immediately**
"I'll set you up right now" > "I'll email you later."
