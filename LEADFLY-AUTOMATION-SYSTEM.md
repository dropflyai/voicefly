## 🔄 Complete Automation Flow

### Step 1: Customer Requests Leads
```typescript
POST /api/leads/request
{
  "businessId": "xxx",
  "criteria": {
    "industry": ["dental", "healthcare"],
    "location": { "state": "Texas" },
    "companySize": { min: 10, max: 50 },
    "jobTitles": ["Owner", "Manager"],
    "limit": 50
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Apollo Search (OUR API KEY)
```typescript
// src/lib/apollo-service.ts
const apollo = getApolloService()
const rawLeads = await apollo.searchLeads(criteria)
// Returns: company info, contact info, location
```

### Step 3: DeepSeek-R1 Research (Each Lead)
```typescript
// For EVERY lead, DeepSeek analyzes:
- Pain points (what problems they face)
- Buying signals (hiring, funding, expansion)
- Decision makers (who to reach)
- Competitor analysis
- Recent news/events
- Best outreach strategy
- Email subject line
- Voice pitch script
- Qualification score (0-100)
```

**Output**: Enriched lead with full intelligence

### Step 4: Auto-Segmentation
```typescript
if (qualificationScore >= 75) → segment = 'hot'
else if (qualificationScore >= 50) → segment = 'warm'
else → segment = 'cold'
```

### Step 5: Auto-Campaign Creation
```typescript
// Cold leads → Email campaign (3-5 touches)
const emailCampaign = await automation.generateEmailCampaign(businessId, coldLeads)

// Warm/Hot leads → Voice campaign (Maya AI calls)
const voiceCampaign = await automation.generateVoiceCampaign(businessId, warmLeads)

// Both campaigns are FULLY WRITTEN with personalized content
```

### Step 6: Lead Nurturing (Automatic)
```typescript
// Track email engagement
- Opens → +10 points
- Clicks → +25 points
- Replies → +50 points

// When lead hits 50+ points → Upgrade to WARM
// Trigger voice campaign automatically
```

### Step 7: Maya AI Books Appointments
```typescript
// Warm/hot leads get called by Maya
// She uses the personalized pitch from DeepSeek research
// Books appointments directly into customer's calendar
```
